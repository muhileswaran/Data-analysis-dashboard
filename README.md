Excited to share my recent project on bike sales analysis in Excel! 🚴‍♂️📊

I applied various Excel techniques, including data cleaning, conditional formatting, duplicate removal, and slicers, to prepare and analyze bike sales data. Using pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and data visualizations, I uncovered trends in customer demographics, purchasing habits, and regional preferences.

Here are a few insights I discovered:

Income Insights: Male buyers had a higher average income than female buyers, with male buyers earning an average of ₹60,124.

Commute Distance: Customers with a commute distance of 0-1 miles purchased  200 bikes, with a total of 1000 purchases.

Age Demographics: Middle-aged customers bought significantly more bikes (383) compared to other age groups. Within this group, age 36 stood out with the highest purchases—30 bikes.

Home Ownership: Homeowners were more likely to purchase bikes compared to renters.

Car Ownership: Interestingly, car owners also purchased more bikes than non-car owners.

Occupational Insights: Clerical workers with an average income of ₹30,000 bought 88 bikes, but overall, those in professional occupations led in total purchases with 276 bikes.

Regional Sales Trends: North America had the highest bike purchases (508), surpassing both Europe and the Pacific regions.

Take a look at the visuals I created to bring these insights to life! 📈 The slicers I used make it easy to filter data by category and explore different dimensions of the dataset.
